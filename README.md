# DSA-Mini-project-
Maze Solver built using Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

This report discusses the design and implementation of the game called maze path finder using Dijkstra’s algorithm. This game is created using tkinter , 
where initial point is give and we have to reach to the final point using shortest path and avoiding the obstructions. 
For the Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph. By normal method, 
the path will be traced wherever it finds no obstruction but by Dijkstra’s algorithm, the path with the minimum distance is traced. 
It differs from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph.

The objective of this mini-project is to understand the concept of Dijkstra’s algorithm in Data Structures and its application and implementation in solving a maze.
